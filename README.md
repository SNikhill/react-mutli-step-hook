# React Multi Step Hook

A Very Simple, Easy To Use Custom React Hook originally meant to Power Multi Steps Forms for a company I worked for.
I figured that the piece of code could be useful as I proceed with development work and converted it to a [Custom React
Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).
